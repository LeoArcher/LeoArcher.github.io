I just started to read Prof Qiu Xipeng's book ["神经网络与深度学习"](https://nndl.github.io/). One of the biggest issues I have right now is that all the terms I have learnt are in English and now I have to translate them into Chinese to be able to understand the book or communicate with others if I got to study in China.
