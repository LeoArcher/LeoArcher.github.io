It has been a bit hard trying to apply for a PhD candicate position... Either no reply or being told all the slots taken. My friends have helped me a lot about which topics are interesting and what I should say to the professor, and even helped me make contact with one of the professor. but to no avail.

I am thinking over it and reckon that I probably need better research records, such as papers or projects. Well, never too late to start. As someone once asked: will you still try if I said you might not have enough time?

Dream it. Do it. Live it.
